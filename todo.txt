shoombabi request:
* can you extend the highlight for the selected row/col to encompass the entirety of 5 boxes maybe in a muted version of the color

* show who still needs to assign challenge before lock in
	* make sure you can't lock in until selections actually made...
	* but let room creator bypass this for blackout bingo for example

* show player colors in the chat and bold the username in chat messages (but not in update messages)

* TEST THIS room timer
	- resync periodically with events
	- store game clock time in the database
	- when displaying, +5:34 would be on the game clock. <abbr> can show
	  the US Eastern date/time or maybe the html5 tag.
	- show who started/stopped the clock and do the permission checks.

* hex spiral of colored icons

* clean up homepage and layout
* test with an actual restreamer

* check discord display name in the log in bridge. notyoung became thomas
* figure out why live updates stop.
* flash of color as it loads personal color...

* counters!


* lockout mode. flip mode. teams - offense try to score for you, defense tries
  to deny other guy a row. like connect 4 lololol
* you might select multiple challenges for the opponents in like triple
  anti-bingo mode.

* right click to private star something you intend to do.......

* show bingos on the player list or something (maybe with a note if they did
  the required one)

* mark squares impossible

* turn off display of other players.

* flag to ignore mutex group.

* can do random challenges in the room flags maybe

* a link to open a room with pre-filled settings.

* try out the browser capture i might make it auto-size and crop.

* count bingos on screen for easier commentation etc

* Alternate views, like list of squares you need to finish bingos


* make the delay remember for restreamers, just players get zero defualt.



* Walk from coneria to elfland and Defeat 3 sahags should be swapped in
  difficulty.

* name reset the seed is buggy.
* swap players back for the room opener.


* "is no longer player X" from quit has the wrong variable in the message
* discord username liable to reset if manually adjusted on next log in.
* change Shinryu TO LordFizzlebeef

* warn if locked in without people picking challenges


* restream mode to trim the output and set a delay

* co-op bingo
	- each player gets a team
	- challenge always just goes to other team if present
	- teams light/unlight for themselves
* idempotency in the swap


* winter theme with demon's mountains

* triple triad bingo

* chase bingo - opponent gets one, you must too. at least until the first
  bingo on either plaer's side




* let players turn off all colors and just show them vs any other on their own
  display


* announce bingos in the chat

* the corners plus the middle are mathematically a bingo too......
