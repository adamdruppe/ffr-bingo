This program runs FFR Bingo as well as the multi-game layout+tracker used for FFR, FFMQ, and others thanks to the ffr marathons.

# Bingo

# Layout

See also my comms_connector program.

# Compiling

If you just want to experiment with layout themes, there's no need to compile the program. You can run the binary release and edit the html and css files (mostly css) and refresh the page in your browser to see the result.

The program is written in the D language using my arsd libraries. You'll need both of them to compile it.
